   To earn prizes in the program, you need to acheive some certain milestones - "The higher the milstones, the higher the prize!"

If we see that you have achieved any milestone, then the prizes associated with those milestones will be delivered to you after the program has ended. üéä (See the <a href="https://dot-space.github.io/GCRF-22/faqs">FAQs </a> section for more information on prizes).
